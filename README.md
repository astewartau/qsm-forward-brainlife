## Running the App 

### On Brainlife.io

You can submit this App online at [https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.444](https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.444) via the "Execute" tab.

### Running Locally (on your machine)

1. git clone this repo.
2. Inside the cloned directory, create `config.json` with something like the following content with paths to your input files.

```json
{
  "t1": "t1.nii.gz"
}
```

3. Launch the App by executing `main`

```bash
./main
```

### Sample Datasets

If you don't have your own input file, you can download sample datasets from Brainlife.io, or you can use [Brainlife CLI](https://github.com/brain-life/cli).

```
npm install -g brainlife
bl login
mkdir input
bl dataset download 5a0f0fad2c214c9ba8624376#5a050966eec2b300611abff2 && mv 5a0f0fad2c214c9ba8624376#5a050966eec2b300611abff2 .
```

## Output

All output file (a resampled T1w NIFTI-1 file) will be generated inside the current working directory (pwd), inside a specifc directory called:

```
out_dir
```

### Dependencies

This App only requires DIPY.org to run.
